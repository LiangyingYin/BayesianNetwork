We provide all R source codes used for simulations

System requirement
1 Operation system: Windows, Linux, Mac OS
2 R version: 3.6.1 and newer
3 Dependencies: pcalg,CePa,reshape2,data.table,dplyr,coop,parallel,graph,grid,Rgraphviz,Corbi,glmnet,MLmetrics,MASS,igraph,stats,RNOmni,ParallelPC,glasso,glassoFast,RBGL,epiR,RiskPortfolios,matrixcalc,CVglasso,iterators,foreach,doParallel,rlist,Matrix. 
4 Main code: Simulation_Overall_Rundata.R
Note: 1)Please change the root path to your own local path to successfully load functions under folders "Simulation_Extension_Functions" and.   "Simulation_Steps_Functions"
      2)Since our code includes a wide range of comparisons, it would be a bit time-consuming to get all the simulation results . 
      3)If you just want to get the main idea of our framework, please choose to run 'Simulation_ToyExample.R' under folder "ToyExample" to save time. (Usually, this can be finished within 30 mins)

5 Toy example: we have provided a toy example under foler "ToyExample" to help illustrate our framework.
