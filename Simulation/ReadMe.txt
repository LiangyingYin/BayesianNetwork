1)  Please install all the related R packages that are needed in our project.
pcalg,CePa,reshape2,data.table,dplyr,coop,parallel,graph,grid,Rgraphviz,Corbi,glmnet,MLmetrics,MASS,igraph,stats,RNOmni,ParallelPC,glasso,glassoFast,RBGL,epiR,RiskPortfolios,matrixcalc,CVglasso,iterators,foreach,doParallel,rlist,Matrix

2) Please amend the root path as your local path.

3) If you want to run the overall simulation code, please run Simulation_Overall_Rundata.R.  We included all the comparision in this program, it would be a bit time-consuming. 

4) If you just want to get the main idea of our framwork, please choose to run 'Simulation_ToyExample.R' to save time.
