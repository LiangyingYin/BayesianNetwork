This folder contain codes used for the inference of gene-outcome causal graph for single traits and multiple traits.
1. Single trait: the studied trait is the target/outcome
2. Multiple traits: Firstly, we need to identify the causal directions between the studied traits, which could be inferred 
   from Mendelian Randomization or extracted from literature. Then, we picked one trait as the “ultimate” outcome (e.g., CAD). 
   As for the ‘exposure’ trait (e.g., BMI, the trait not designated as outcome), we first calculated the polygenic risk scores (PRS) 
   of all involved subjects based on external GWAS summary data. Then we randomly selected 5,000 subjects to build a prediction model 
   to predict the exposure trait based on calculated PRSs. Subsequently, we applied the built model to predict the value of exposure 
   trait for the remaining subjects. In this study, a linear model was used to predict the value of the continuous exposure trait, while 
   a logistic model was used for the binary exposure trait. The predicted exposure trait could be regarded as a special 
   (imputed/genetically predicted) ‘gene’. After that, we combined the predicted exposure trait with the imputed gene expression profiles 
   to infer the “gene”-outcome causal network.
