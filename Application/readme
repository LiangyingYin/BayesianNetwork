The folder contains codes used to infer the causal graphs for studied continuous and binary traits in the UK Biobank. To use the code for the inference of 
gene-outcome causal network, we need to "predict" the tissue specific gene expression profiles from raw genotypes using "PredXican" 
first(https://github.com/hakyimlab/PrediXcan).
