The folder contains codes we used to infer the causal graphs for studied continuous and binary traits in the UK Biobank. To use the code for the inference of gene-outcome causal network, we need to "predict" the tissue specific gene expression profiles from raw genotypes using "PredXican" first(https://github.com/hakyimlab/PrediXcan). 

Steps to estimate the causal graphs for studied traits
1. Gene_Interaction_Network_Inference
2. Gene_outcome_network_inference
3. Merge_graphs


Note: Steps 1 and 2 are interchangable
