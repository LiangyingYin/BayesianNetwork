Both exploratory and selective analysis were performed for gene interaction network inference.

1.Exploratory analysis: we kept genes consistent with those from the gene-outcome causal network. When using "PrediXcan" to predict tissue specific 
  expression profiles, only genes with reliable predicted expression data were preserved. Since the gene-outcome causal network for the studied trait
  was inferred from the 'predicted' tissue specific expression profile, we can only identify the causal relationship between genes with reliable predicted
  expression data and the studied outcome.

2.Selective analysis: we only selected a subset of genes from the first strategy. Suppose N_c is the number of identified directly causal genes for the 
  studied traits. If N_c > 150, then the top 150 directly causal genes with the largest z scores will be selected. If 20 <= N_c < =150, then all directly 
  causal genes will be selected.
