This folder contains codes for exploratory gene interaction network inference. The codes are listed in sequential order. 

Steps for exploratory gene interaction network inference:
1. get deconfounded GTEx tissue-specific expression profiles by adjusting for possible confounders
2. get GTEx tissue-specific expression profile for common genes between GTEx and imputed tissue-specific expression profile from UK Biobank
3. get gene interaction networks by the PC algorithm and detect if the inferred networks are valid CPDAG
4. get gene interaction networks by the CAM(Causal Additive Model)
5. get valid gene interaction network based on step 3 and 4
