This folder contains codes for selective gene interaction network inference. The codes are listed in sequential order. 

Steps for selective gene interaction network inference:
1. get deconfounded GTEx tissue-specific expression profiles by adjusting for possible confounders
2. get GTEx tissue-specific expression profile for direct causal genes for the studied traits
3. get gene interaction networks by the bootstrapped-PC algorithm
