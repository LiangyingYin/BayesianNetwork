The folder contains codes used to infer the causal graphs for studied continuous and binary traits in the UK Biobank. To use the code for the inference of 
gene-outcome causal network, we need to "predict" the tissue specific gene expression profiles from raw genotypes using "PredXican" 
first(https://github.com/hakyimlab/PrediXcan). 

Steps to estimate the causal graphs for studied traits
1. Gene_outcome_network_inference
2. Gene_Interaction_Network_Inference
3. Merge_networks

Note: the filepaths should be revised accordingly if run the code locally. Due to privacy issues, we could not provide the original UK Biobank data used 
for the analysis. If there are any problems, please feel free to contact the authors.
